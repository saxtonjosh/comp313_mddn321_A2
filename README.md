# Git rules

Please do not commit directly to master. You should create a new branch then pull request into it. 

Before doing an stash, please talk to the team first.

When committing to your branch with files that solve an issue use "Fixes #" or "Closes #" in the
commit description to close the issue associated with the number "#" when you merge back into master.

# Git base command :

git commit -m " your commit "

git push origin <branch>
  
git push ( use this when you are in the right branch )
  
git checkout <branch>  ( change branch, you should change branch first then pull-push)
  
git pull
